### True Mind: A Code of Conduct
*by Shawn Ashley Wilson*

What follows is a certain code of conduct, moral directives, or attempted philosophy of logical reasoning that I personally try to follow. I don't claim to invent any of these ideas, merely collecting those I find that work. I won't preach that these should apply to everyone, I can only share how they apply to me and perhaps others also find this useful. Most importantly, these ideas may change as I grow and learn.

## Origins

## Promises

## Life Game Challenge

## Everything is Dangerous: from Enjoyment to Overconsumption

## Earth is not a Clean Room: With Ease or Dis-Ease
